Currently I'm staying in Singapore. There are many districts in Singapore (e.g Raffles Place, Cecil, Marina, People's Park, etc.).

The list of Singapore district can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Singapore

We as a young family really enjoy Tiong Bahru whichis the oldest housing estate in Singapore.

When you visit this quaint community, you’ll immediately notice an intriguing mix of old and new. While many older residents have lived in the shophouses and flats here for decades, the younger generation flocks here for the food, shops, and culture.

The problem:
We want to live there but renting an apartment there is very expensive. We need to look for another district which is similar to Tiong Bahru but the rental is cheaper. 

In addition, I'm a frequent traveller. Thus, I want to stay somewhere not very far from the Changi airport.

The Solution:
- Classify districts into based on Points of Interests (e.g coffee shop, barkery, etc.). 
- We may also look into the rental and distance to Airport as well
